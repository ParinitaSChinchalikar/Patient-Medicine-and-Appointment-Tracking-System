# Patient-Medicine-and-Appointment-Tracking-System

## ABSTRACT

Today’s life is much digitalized and fast. Now everything is done at fingertips on our mobile phones so easily. In this busy lifestyle one must not ignore their health. Work goes on but forgetting your timely routine checkup is not acceptable. We have come up with the solution to this problem in our project “Patient Medicine and Appointment Tracking System”. PMATS (Patient Medicine and Appointment Tracking System) will be a Web app to help people with their medicine and doctors’ routine. The Purpose of the system is to assist people in reminding them about tracking and scheduling appointments at the clinic.
It provides an interface through which user can track and schedule the appointment. Our PMATS web app makes it easy to set up all aspects of user’s treatment. Our mission is to simplify your treatment plan no matter how complex it is and to make it possible for you to take control of your own health. Patient does not need to carry the files of previously held check-up. This application provides a log-in for doctor and patient as well. Doctor can access the medical diagnose information of the patient. Patient is registered with a unique ID. So, the database of history of a patient is available with all the doctors registered with the application.
